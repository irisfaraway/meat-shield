# meat-shield.js

I'm vegetarian but frequently buy products with meat by accident when ordering food online.

Rather than pay more attention to what I'm doing, I thought I'd just highlight the dreaded meaty words with a userscript instead.

This was adapted from some code Chris let me pinch (thanks Chris!)
