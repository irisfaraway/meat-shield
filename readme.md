# Meat shield

I am a vegetarian but frequently buy products with meat during online grocery shops by accident.

Rather than pay more attention to what I'm doing, I thought I'd just highlight the dreaded meaty words with a userscript instead.

This was adapted from some code Chris let me pinch (thanks Chris!)
